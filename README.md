🧠 Management of Information Systems & 💻 Infrastructure Technologies
This repository contains labs, case studies, and strategic assignments completed during my coursework in Management of Information Systems (MIS) and Infrastructure Technologies. These projects reflect both my technical and strategic understanding of how businesses can leverage IT to enhance performance and solve real-world challenges.

📊 MIS: Case Studies & Strategic Analysis
Conducted in-depth case studies on real companies to identify system inefficiencies and propose IT-driven solutions.

Completed strategic assignments on how organizations can better utilize information systems for growth and competitive advantage.

Developed recommendations based on current industry trends, focusing on alignment between business goals and technology.

🖥️ Infrastructure Technologies: Hands-on Labs
Worked on several lab assignments involving Windows command-line operations, batch file scripting, and directory management, including:

for example Lab 2 Highlights:

Created a full batch script to automate file system tasks and demonstrate knowledge of system commands:

batch
Copy
Edit
@echo off
echo This is my Lab 2 batch file
tree C:\
tree /F C:\
mkdir C:\SCORES
rmdir /Q /S C:\SCORES
copy loop.bat C:\SCORES
pause
dir C:\ | sort > DirList
sort /R Names > Names_Sorted
Captured and submitted full directory structures using the TREE command.

Utilized piping, redirection, and file manipulation to manage system output.

Practiced real-world infrastructure tasks such as file backup, cleanup, and system documentation.

These projects built my skills in both business IT strategy and technical infrastructure, giving me a well-rounded understanding of how to manage and improve information systems from both ends.
